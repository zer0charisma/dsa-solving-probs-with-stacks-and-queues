# Matching Parentheses

Arithmetic expressions may contain parentheses for clarification. For example the following expression is valid:

```
(a + b) * c
```

But the following expression is not:

```
((a + b) * c
```

Write an algorithm that accepts an expression as a string and returns `true` if the parentheses in the expression match and `false` otherwise.
